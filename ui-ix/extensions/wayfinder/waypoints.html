			<h3>Wayfinders</h3>
			<p>Wayfinders are a great way to communicate to users where they are within a long
			  page of sections. They can be used with any type of navigation (horizontal or vertical). Just use
			  the class <code>js_waypointNav</code> for the navigation and <code>js_waypoints</code> for the
			  container of sections (<code>div</code>'s <code>li</code>'s or <code>dd</code>'s)</p>

			<p>The demo of the wayfinder is this page's navigation. You're likely already using it.</p>
